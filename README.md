# So you want to install Gentoo?
### I'd just like to interject for a moment...

My aim is to make your installation as simple as possible. This will start out as a series of instructions, but maybe some day I'll create some scripts to help you better.

This information will be mostly taken from the excellent youtube video by [Mental Outlaw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yxJoMa05ZM&feature=emb_title), but more generalised than the video he made for his own PC.

This guide will be for x86_64 PCs (which Gentoo calls amd64). More details can be found in the [Gentoo AMD64 Handbook](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:AMD64) if you desire.

## Getting Started

Before you do anything else, you'll want to get your hands on the latest live CD. You can download it [here](https://www.gentoo.org/downloads/). You will need to burn this to a USB flash drive (a CD might work too, but I've never tried).

Once that's done, reboot your PC and boot from the USB. You will boot from the live image.
