# This file is used by Portage to customise your packages.
# Check the manual page for make.conf or the gentoo wiki for more flags.

# These flags are used by your PC's C, C++, and Fortran compilers.
# In this file, all these compilers will use the same flags.
# --march=native will compile all packages for your PC's architecture, 
#    ensuring nothing is ever cross-compiled.
# -O2 means our compiler will try and optimise code during compilation.
#    It's not recommended to go to -O3 for all packages, so we'll go
#    with the -O2.
# -pipe dictates how different stages of compilation communicate.
#    -pipe means use pipes instead of temporary files.

# MAKEOPTS determines how many parallel compilations should occur when
# installing a package. It's usually not worth making this higher than the
# number of cores your CPU has (in my case, four).
# -j is the number of cores.
# -l is the maximum allowed load average, which should be about j*0.9

# Portage uses the USE variable to determine the default way to build
# a package. You can add/remove flags using the USE variable in this file.
# NOTE: This does not overwrite the value of USE that Portage uses, it only
# appends to it! It also applies to ALL packages you build, so only
# put a flag here if you want it to apply system-wide!
#  alsa:       Add support for the advanced linux sound architecture.
#  elogind:    Build packages that normally require logind from systemd.
#  examples:   Download code examples where applicable.
#  ipv6 :      Add support for ipv6.
#  multilib:   Allow compilation of 32-bit binaries.
#  nouveau:    Build all packages to make use of open-source nouveau drivers.
#  nvidia:     Enable nvidia-specific features.
#  opengl:     Add support for openGL graphics.
#  pulseaudio: Add support for PulseAudio.
#  qt4:        Add support for the Qt4 framework.
#  qt5:        Add support for the Qt5 framework.
#  udev:       Enable virtual/udev integration.
#  X:          Add support for X11.
#  -emacs:     Don't add support for emacs, since I use vim.
#  -gnome:     Don't add GNOME support.
#  -systemd:   Don't use systemd-specific libraries.
#  -wifi:      Don't enable wifi functionality.
